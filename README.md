# Hanoi-Towers-with-Visual-Steps
This repository is a representation of the Hanoi Towers problem which shows using a .svg out file every step that the algorithm is making until it ends. When the out file is opened every step is represented by a row, every single row containing 3 plates, and the n ( numbers of disks, which is read from the standard input ) disks that are placed in the correct plate of the current step.
